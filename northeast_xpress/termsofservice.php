                        YOUR PROPERTY: We are not responsible for watching your equipment, vehicle, or personal
                        property. We provide a parking space with fencing and lights and sometimes electronic gates. You
                        are parking at your own risk as there is no security watching your vehicle. You must have your
                        own insurance as we are not responsible for anything that may happen to your vehicle. It is up
                        to you to protect and secure your vehicle and belongings. You can protect your vehicle(s) and
                        property using a kingpin device to secure your trailer. Also, wheel locks, steering wheel locks
                        are also suggested where applicable in securing your vehicle or possessions. We also strongly
                        suggest that you always have a GPS tracking or locating device installed on your vehicle or
                        trailer at all times while storing or parking your vehicle or trailer. If you have loaded
                        trailers, you are at risk for theft, and we strongly suggest that you leave your loaded trailer
                        in one of our manned, secured lots. Ask us where our secured LOTS are located, so we can better
                        assist you. </p>
